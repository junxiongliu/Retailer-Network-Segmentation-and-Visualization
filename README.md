## Overview
This is a demonstration of a retailer network segmentation project that we worked on between January 2018 and June 2018 for a e-commerce company. We analyzed customer orders data and produced valuable insights and tools for our client. We recreated the main part of this project with completely regenerated data. This repository will show you our work.<br />

## App
**Our dashboard is hosted [[here](http://ec2-54-172-116-217.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8000/)]**. Please **open this via a PC** to ensure best viewing experience (i.e. 13-14 inch laptops work great). Also, we recorded a 10-minute video to show you how to use this dashboard and **feel free to check it out [[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pZ1auhAHIisZUZSc3qX44Varwa-Lxw7b)]**. <br />

## Important Files
* `data` folder aims to contain all data. We recreated raw data from scratch and relevant data can be downloaded from this [[link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c3cOjBxsaVJHyBydR_NjhmzaAuLE9Qvw)].
	* `generated` subfolder aims to contain all data generated by files in `scripts\data_creation`. 
	* `raw` subfolder aims to contain raw orders data we recreated for this project. Note that you will only get a sample of this raw data from the download folder. Please contact us if you are interested in more details.
* `scripts` folder contains all scripts that we used in this project.
	* `analysis` subfolder contains scripts to analyze the data.
	* `data_creation` subfolder contains scripts to create the data from raw.
	* `viz` subfolder contains the files to run the visualization.

## General Requirements
Below are some general requirements to reproduce this project:
* `Python 3.6` with common data science libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, etc
* `RStudio` version 1.1.419 and `R` version 3.4.3

## Details & Steps To Run
* Data creation/generation:<br/>
	* The data can be downloaded from this [[link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c3cOjBxsaVJHyBydR_NjhmzaAuLE9Qvw)]. Plase un-zip it and copy it to the data folder in the root directory **and** copy the `generated` folder to `scripts/viz/data/generated` directory in order to run the visualization. 
	* To recreate the generated data from raw data, please run the following scripts in `scripts/data_creation` folder **in order**: `network_data_aggregation.Rmd`, `analysis_data_preparation.Rmd`, `viz_data_preparation_general.Rmd`, `viz_data_link_establish.Rmd`, and `viz_data_preparation_graph.py`.
* Data Analysis:<br/>
	* `scripts/analysis/analysis.Rmd` file includes a simplified version of our original analysis. 
	* The main objective is to segment retailers in the network in order to inform strategies such as cross-sell. In this analysis, we used various machine learning techniques including unsupervised methods (PCA, Clusterings) as well as supervised approaches (Trees, Regressions).
* Data Visualization:<br/>
	* Copy all data files under `data/generated` folder to `scripts/viz/data`. You can use one command to do this. Go into `scripts/viz` folder first, then type `Xcopy ..\..\data\generated data\` in windows cmd or `cp -r ../../data/generated/. data/` in Linux cmd.
	* Stay in `scripts/viz` folder. Type `python -m http.server` in consle/cmd. Afterwards open up your browser and type `localhost: 8000` (or whatever default port you set up) and you should be able to see the visualization exactly like the screenshot above.
	* In general, the main objective of the visualization is to provide a comprehensive approach to visualize this unique network/orders data. The dashboard is divided into three parts (`Retailer KPI`, `Network Structure`, and `Filters`):
		* `Retailer KPI` is on the left part of the page. It contains three graphs related to focal retailer of your choice and it presents key information such as sales, orders, and cross-sell about the focal retailer against its competitiors.
		* `Network Structure` is on the middle of the page. It contains the structure of the full retailer network where nodes are retailers and edges represent amount of cross-sell between retailers (or a.k.a "customer flow"). The graph is colored by our **clustering results** from the analysis part. 
		* `Filters` is on the right and this section controls the graphs of the other two sections. "Network Filter" controls the `Network Structure` section and "Retailer Filter" controls the `Retailer KPI` section.
			* Note: For `Category` and `Competitiors` boxes, you can press `Ctrl` (for Windows users) to multi-select.
